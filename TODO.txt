FMM method
    properly define the precision number (probably more in accordance with the paper)
    speed up FMM method constant compute time
        is ~O(N) currently, but want to reduce the constant factor

(
assign acceleration function to universe class instead of constantly passing around
    should be a bit cleaner

calculate accelerations using more numpy
    not really useful as order N method
